## Download Firmware

You can find the latest firmware releases at [https://github.com/pimoroni/pico-lipo/releases/latest](https://github.com/pimoroni/pico-lipo/releases/latest).

For each board there are two choices, a regular build that just updates the firmware and a "-with-examples" build which includes a selection of [examples](examples) depending upon your board.

:warning: If you've changed any of the code on your board then back up before flashing "-with-examples" - *your files will be erased!*

## Installation

1. Connect your LiPo board to your computer with a USB Type-C cable.
2. Put your device into bootloader mode by holding down the BOOT button and toggling the power off/on.
3. Drag and drop the downloaded .uf2 to the "RP2350" drive that appears.
4. Your device should reset, and you should be able to connect to it using Thonny.
